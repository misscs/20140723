						I work at a awesome little company called OddBird with some of the
						most amazing, talented, and warm-hearted people ever.

						You may recognize one of birds, Eric Suzanne, who spoke at the last
						SF Mixin.

						The number one question I've received since joining OddBird, is what do you do
						at Oddbird. Because of our NDAs I can't talk or demo our projects (until they are public)

						Today I'm going to talk about a components of what I do.

						At OddBird, I've primarily been working as front-end architect. Eric is resonsible
						for UX/Design and I am responsible for implementation.

						One of my first tasks at OddBird was to document our front-end patterns (components).
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><q>
						The way we presently architect the front-end is very strange and even a
						bit broken. In many instances you're either copying huge chunks of HTML
						out of some doc and then pasting that into your app (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.),
						or you're sprinkling the page with jQuery plugins that have to be
						configured using JavaScript.
						<b>
							In an ideal scenario, the HTML language would be expressive enough to
							create complex UI widgets and also extensible so that we,
							the developers, could fill in any gaps with our own tags.

					<p><cite>Rob Dodson,
						<em><a href="http://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/">
						A Guide to Web Components</a></em>
					</cite></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						When I first started looking at it, I realized our code was broken. We
						were copying huge chunks of HTML around; similar patterns would suffer from
						the slightly different variation.

						I wanted a way to take a component, or chunk of HTML + classes, and
						easily render it in our documentation and also have a way to.

						Consequently, I become obsessed with HTML. I was feeling a bit sheepish
						about my new love considering that Sass is the new thing,

				<section>
					<p><q>[Web] Components are ushering in a HTML renaissance, encouraging us to
					think about how we can bring back the declarative simplicity of HTML
					to the components we write today.<q><p>
					<p>Componenent allow us to bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements that
						fully encapsulate all of their HTML, CSS and behaviors (JS).</p>


					<aside class="notes">
						but then
						I came across Web Componenents and breathed a sigh of relief. I was on track,
						even though I wasn't using Web Components. Our goal's are the the same: build elements that are (potentially) more
						maintainable and more encapsulated.

						Web components are of the browser, they tap into the ShadowDom and have more capabilities.

						We don't have to use Web Components to apply the principles of building
						HTML widgets, building encapsulated objects.
						In fact, the Ember project goes so far as to create their own component object
						that keeps aware of the spec progress. they fully intended to integrate once
						web components become a standard

						As we know all to well with Sass adoption,
						any new standard can be controversial and in the case of Web Components
						it does seems that they are especially polarizing.

						Let's look at how we can begin to prepare ourselves for the not so distant future.

						<h1>Materials matter</h1>
						<h2 class="orange">Pick a robust templating language</h2>

						<p>Templating languages are to HTML what pre-processors are to CSS</p>


						<aside class="notes">
							Prior to starting at OddBird I never
 							thought much about my templating language. Usually just worked
 							in the constraints of the project. I enjoyed HAML because it meant
 							writing less HTML cruft.

 							HTML, much like CSS, is a flat language.

 							As Rob wrote "In an ideal scenario,
 							the HTML language would be expressive enough to
							create complex UI widgets and also extensible so that we,
							the developers, could fill in any gaps with our own tags."

							Enter HTML templating languages. not all templating languages are
							created equal. We were using Django's templating engine which has
							the common concept of partials.

							I quickly realized that Django wasn't going to cut it even with partials.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-state="partials">
						<h1>Partials</h1>
						<p class="red">will only get you part way there</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Much like Sass partials, HTML partials feel more like a way of grouping/
							separating like code to create more manageable files.

							Partials fall short when you try to design reseuable components.
							There's no easy way to include a partial within a partial
							....not to mention the performance implications.

							I needed something that was more like a function...
							Because I primarily build complex apps,
							not simple sites, I am always striving to be as DRY as possible.

						<h1>Hello, <b class="orange">macros</b></h1>
						<p>Macros are comparable with functions in regular programming languages.</p>
<pre><code>
{% for c in people %}
  {{ people_macros.render_summary(c) }}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<img src="img/rendered-macro.png">

						<aside class="notes">
							Macros on the other hand are like mixins. In fact Jade calls them
							mixins.

							Creating reusueable macros is a similar mental model to building
							a web component (from what I've read).

						<aside class="notes">
							A bit of research led me to Jinja, a templating language that reminds me
							of Liquid, which the the templating language for Jekyll static site generator
							created by Shopify.

							since I'm handing off projects, I try to be aware of learning curve and don't
							want to go completely new, like Jade.

						<h1 class="is-hidden">Nunjucks</h1>
						<p><q>“Nunjucks has allowed us to port all of our existing templates from

						By moving our templates to the client, transfer sizes are reduced
						and page responsiveness increases significantly.
						<strong>Our API supplies data, meaning we can decouple testing the
						front-end from testing the back-end.</strong>
						Nunjucks has made our app feel native.”</q></p>
						<p><cite>– Matt Basta, Firefox Marketplace team</cite></p>

						What we are striving for is not new or original.
						Duplication (inadvertent or purposeful duplication)
						can lead to maintenance nightmares, poor factoring, and
						logical contradictions. AVOID IT


						Macros allow us to have one Single Origin or Truth for our HTML.

						Sweet. So now we had a much faster site. Like Mozilla, we saw drasitic
						improvements in performance and compilation times.

						But there was still a problem. We use Sass maps for configuration, from
						colors, to typography, to sizing. We found ourselves duplicating our Sass
						code in our styleguide.I took a look at our python dictionaries and
						realized that they looked just like sass maps.

						But what could we use for Sass.
